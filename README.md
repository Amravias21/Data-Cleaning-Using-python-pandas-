## Data Cleaning Using Python Pandas and NumPy

## Overview:
This repository contains two datasets aimed at demonstrating data cleaning techniques using the pandas library in Python. The datasets are:
1. chipotle.tsv
2. Data Cleaning (Pandas)

## Dataset-1 :
- **File:** Data Cleaning (Pandas)
- **Description:** This dataset comprises information related to individuals, including Age, Salary, Rating, Location, Established, and Easy Apply.
- **Objective:** The aim here is to utilize pandas library in Python to perform data cleaning tasks on this dataset.

## Dataset-2 :
- **File:** chipotle.tsv
- **Description:** This dataset contains information about orders from a Chipotle restaurant. It includes columns such as Order Id, Quantity, Item Name, Choice Description, and Item Price.
- **Objective:** The goal is to clean the data to prepare it for analysis or further processing.

## Tasks:
1. **Loading Data:** Load the datasets into pandas dataframes.
2. **Initial Inspection:** Check the structure of the dataframes, including data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
3. **Data Cleaning Steps:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Standardize or correct inconsistent data entries.
   - Convert data types if necessary.
   - Remove duplicates.
   - Address any outliers or anomalies.
   - Ensure consistency and coherence in the datasets.
4. **Data Transformation:** Perform any necessary transformations to make the data suitable for analysis.
5. **Save Cleaned Data:** Save the cleaned datasets for future use.

## Instructions:
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the pandas library.
2. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a Python environment or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Load the datasets using pandas.
5. Follow the data cleaning steps mentioned above, using appropriate pandas functions and methods.
6. Execute the data transformation steps as required.
7. Save the cleaned datasets to a preferred file format (e.g., CSV) for future analysis or usage.

## Note: 
- Keep track of the changes made during the cleaning process.
- Document any assumptions or decisions made while cleaning the data.
- Test the cleaned datasets thoroughly to ensure they meet the analysis requirements.
